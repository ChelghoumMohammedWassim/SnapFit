Today, people are very interested in sports and want to share their experiences, but they can only do so with a limited number of people because there is a severe lack of social networks designed for this field. The purpose of this project is to provide a social network that facilitates the user's acquisition of sports-related information, reduces the time spent searching for information, and allows users to share their experiences by using images or videos. In our application, the user must create their own account to access the homepage where they can view other people's posts. They can view the details of each physical exercise publication (image) and can interact by liking it to add it to their favorites list. They can also watch explanatory videos, where they will find the title of each video and the publisher's email. The user has the freedom to navigate the application using the navigation menu and can view their profile, where they can find the exercises they have published and can delete them. They can also view and modify their profile picture as well as their favorites list at any time. This application gives every user the freedom to publish physical exercises in the form of images or videos. Additionally, the application provides an option that allows users to calculate approximate statistics of their movements.
